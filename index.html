            <p> Hi, I'm Jordan. I study applied mathematics at the University of Waterloo. I'm also working as an intern at 
                <a href="https://perimeterinstitute.ca/" target="_blank">The Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics</a>,
                researching causal inference and its applications in industry. </p>
            <p> I am endlessly fascinated by the natural world and the place we have in it. More specifically, how the phenomena we observe can be understood and predicted 
                through the lens of mathematics. This website serves as a place to show some of my explorations of math in the wider world. Check out 'My Projects' to 
                see what I've been working on. I hope you find something here that interests or inspires you! </p>
            <p> In my spare time, I enjoy hockey and board games. They both often give me inspiration for projects.</p>
